# Funq: The Fast DI Container You Can Understand

Based on the original project on [Codeplex](https://funq.codeplex.com/) and the active version included in [ServiceStack](http://servicestack.net).  

This version is:

- __Standalone__.  A single .NET library available on NuGet
- __Up-to-date__.  Bug fixes and working unit tests
- __Stripped down__.  Just .NET Core and PCL versions
- __Enhanced__.  Includes ServiceStack enhancements such as auto-wiring.
- __Documentate__.  A wiki with a Getting Started guide.
- __Centralized__.  One place for the source, links to the original videos by Daniel Cazzulino and other references.

Enjoy!
